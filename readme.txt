This plugin adds responsiveness settings to Row and other select blocks. It also introduces responsive visibility settings to all blocks, and more.

== Description ==
The WordPress Block Editor provides a simple and intuitive way to visually build a complete website. It’s a breath of fresh air compared to the clutter of other page builders! But have you ever wished it had more responsiveness settings than just “stack on mobile”? You’ve probably tried various responsive block plugins, only to find they add clutter, glitch, and still don’t meet your needs. We, at Dream Theme, have been there as well. But the benefit of being a WordPress theme development company is that we can build the tools we and our clients need!


Introducing “Comprehensive Responsiveness for Block Editor.” This simple plugin does exactly what the title says: it enhances the Block Editor by adding comprehensive responsiveness to the Row block and responsive visibility settings to all blocks. No unnecessary clutter. This functionality allows you to create fully responsive layouts—something that is not possible in vanilla WordPress.


Additionally, we’ve included responsiveness settings for Navigation and Columns. The Grid is next on our hit list.


The responsiveness switching points are fully customizable, with support for custom points as well. Different features can be enabled or disabled selectively through a simple settings interface.


The plugin also adds a small library of responsive patterns to the Block Editor to give you an idea of what you can build with it. This is something we plan to expand on in the future.


We hope the community finds this plugin useful, and we always appreciate your feedback!
